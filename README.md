## **LeetCode Solutions**

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, written in mostly C# with unit tests.  
I use this repo to track my progress, strengthen problem-solving skills, and practice writing organized and tested code.

- **Problem folders** → Named with LeetCode # and problem title  
- **Solution.cs** → Each file includes:
  - Problem link and short description 
  - My approach notes (why I solved it this way)
  - Implementation
  - MSTest unit tests
